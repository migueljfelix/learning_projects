          <p>Chicken stew is a warming, filling meal that’s perfect through the fall
            and winter months. If you’ve been feeling like your standby chicken
            recipes are getting old, this flavor-packed Slow Cooker Chicken Apricot
            Stew is the perfect recipe to ignite your palate.
            
            I use chermoula, a North African sauce that I love for its variety of
            herbs, spices, and preserved lemons, as a marinade to impart deep flavor
            into the chicken. The chicken is cooked with the marinade, so the sauce
            infuses the meat as it simmers.
            
            Additionally, the stew contains a hearty serving of chopped apricots, as
            dried fruit its common in tagines, recipes made in a cooking vessel of the
            same name, and Moroccan cooking in general.
            
            The apricots lose their structure and melt into the sauce, mellowing out
            and sweetening the otherwise punchy chermoula. With greens added late in
            the cooking process, but long enough for them to cook down and meld into
            the stew, this chicken stew is a well-rounded dish that is at once
            herbaceous, rich, and healthful.
            
            I enjoy it over couscous or rice, but it works well with other grains,
            too. The best part of this recipe is that it is super flexible! You can
            marinate the chicken for anywhere from an hour to a full day, and you can
            cook the dish on high or low in your slow cooker. This dish allows you to
            craft a fancy-feeling weeknight or weekend meal with very little hands-on
            time. It serves four, reheats nicely, and freezes well.</p>

            <h2>Inspiration for This Recipe</h2>

            <p>Tagine is a cooking vessel popular in Morocco, and it’s also the name of
              the dishes cooked in it.
              
              Chicken tagines are popular because the shape of the vessel, which are
              similar to Dutch ovens but have a cone shaped top for trapping steam,
              which makes the food cooked in them tender and flavorful.
              
              Because tagines aren’t common to have in homes in the U.S., I’ve revised a
              popular Moroccan chicken tagine to be made in a slow cooker. The final
              presentation of tender, highly flavored chicken is similar to a recipe
              made in the more traditional tagine.
              
              As for the vegetables in the dish, traditional chicken tagines commonly
              employ zucchini, cauliflower, or potatoes. Because those tend to break
              down if cooked too long, I’ve instead chosen lacinato kale (also called
              black kale) because it can be cooked nearly endlessly without losing its
              structure.</p>

              <h2>Tips and Tricks for Slow Cooker Chicken Tagine</h2>


              <h4>Follow these steps to ensure your tagine is perfect.</h4>
                <ol>  
                  <li>While it’s tempting to skip the browning step for the chicken and
                  onions, it won’t have as much flavor or color if you do.</li>
                  <li>If there are a lot of brown bits left in the pan after sautéing, deglaze with a couple tablespoons of the chicken stock, and add to the slow cooker.</li>
                  <li>The chicken will be tender after four hours of cooking but will not
                    suffer if you want to let it go longer; I’ve left it on low for about
                    six hours and had it still be perfectly textured.</li>
                  <li>Any onions can be used in both the chermoula and the tagine, but I love
                      sweet onions because of how they balance the tart pungency of the sauce.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Swaps and Substitutions</h2>
                <h4>Don’t have everything on hand? No problem!</h4>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Collard greens can be substituted for the black kale; add them at the same
                      time and cut them similarly. If you don’t have either, add a bag of
                      spinach at the end of the cooking time, and stir until wilted.</li>
                    <li>
                      Beef or mushroom stock can be used instead of chicken stock.
                    </li>

                    <li> This recipe could be made with lamb or beef instead of chicken. Oxtails
would work best, since ideally you’ll want to use a bone in cut. </li>
                </ul>

                <h1>Serving Suggestions </h1>
                <p>Traditionally this dish is served over couscous, but it
                  could also be scooped over jasmine rice or quinoa. If
                  you’re experimenting with grains, this stew is a great one to play with
                  for that!</p>

                  <h1>Storage Instructions</h1>
                  <p>Store any unused portions in a tightly sealed container for up to four
                    days. Reheat on the stove over medium heat.
                    To freeze, place the tagine in a tightly sealed container once chilled,
                    and freeze for up to three months. Let it thaw in the fridge before
                    reheating.</p>
